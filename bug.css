The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special div {
  color: red;
}

#special div {
  color: green;
}

#special .special div {
  color: purple;
}

<div id="special" class="special"></div>
```

The expected output would be purple for the div element because `#special .special div` is most specific. But in some CSS implementations due to the order of selector evaluation it will return green instead of purple.

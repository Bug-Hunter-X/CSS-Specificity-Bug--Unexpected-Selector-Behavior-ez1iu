To resolve this, ensure selectors are unambiguous and consistent:

```css
/* Solution: More robust and unambiguous selectors */
#special.special div {
  color: purple;
}
div {
  color: blue;
}
.special div {
  color: red;
}
#special div {
  color: green;
}
```

By combining the ID and class selectors (`#special.special div`), you avoid ambiguity that could cause unpredictable behavior in different CSS engines.
